          <p>
              The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and stylish
          platform that elevates your screen to a more comfortable viewing height.
          Placing your monitor at eye level has the potential to improve your posture
          and make you more comfortable while at work, helping you stay focused on the
          task at hand.
          <br>
          <br>
          Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the simplicity of design
          creates extra desk space below your computer to allow notepads, pens, and
          USB sticks to be stored under the stand.
